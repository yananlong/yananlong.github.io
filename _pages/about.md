Welcome to my personal webiste! I am a data scientist and machine learning researcher. I recently concluded my role of Research Scientist at the University of Chicago. Prior to that, I obtained by PhD from the same place under [Andrey Rzhetsky](https://biologicalsciences.uchicago.edu/faculty/andrey-rzhetsky).

My research mainly focuses on ML for scientific applications, in particular to biomedical sciences, where I integrate knowledge from domain experts into predictive modelling and employ Bayesian statistic for rigorous model evaluation. I also work on mechanistic interpretability for machine translation models, with a particular focus on gender biases and non-binary gender identities. Beyond technical research, I critically interrogate AI use socio-technical methods and participatory design.

**I am currently on both the industry and academic job markets for positions in applied data science or AI for science!**
